OChestDump v0.7
Copyright (c) 2011 Nayruden <http://omnivr.net>

OChestDump allows you to dump the contents of your inventory to a chest, or to
dump the contents of a chest into your inventory, or to swap the contents of a
chest with your inventory, or to sort a chest.

To use, type "/ocd swap", "/ocd loot", "/ocd stash", or "/ocd sort" in chat
while looking at a chest. Typing "/ocd" in chat will bring up the help for the
command.

Loot fits as many items from the chest into your inventory as possible.
Stash fits as many items from your inventory into the chest as possible.
Swap simply swaps the items from the chest and your inventory as best as it can.
You can add an item name or ID after swap or loot to exchange only the specified
item.
Sort allows you to sort a chest by name (default) or total amount of items.

All commands combine stacks where possible to save space!
